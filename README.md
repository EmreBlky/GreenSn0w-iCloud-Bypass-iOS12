# GreenSn0w-iCloud-Bypass-iOS12
iOS 12-12.5.6 iCloud Bypass tool. Tethered using checkra1n. Designed by @ios_euphoria on twitter.

Make sure you have tkinter, sshpass, libmobiledevice and python3 installed! Look up yourself how to install those.

Steps to bypass iOS 12.0-12.5.6

Open Terminal and enter:
cd DRAG AND DROP GREENSN0W FOLDER HERE
python3 GUI.py
Now jailbreak your device. If your device just boots, try again until it boots verbose mode.
After jailbreak, Inject Payload. If successfully injecting payload, phone will shutdown.
Boot device into DFU mode and run checkra1n again. Must see verbose mode to continue to next step.
Then run 'Make it Sn0w' and device will respring. After respring, you will be at home screen!

Enjoy <3
